# Fast React Pizza Co.

Fast React Pizza Co. is an online ordering platform for a small pizza shop. It features a dynamic menu fetched from an API, a cart feature to hold items you want to purchase, and an ordering form complete with a geolocation feature.

It features more advanced React techniques including data fetching with React Router, Redux Toolkit / Thunks, and fetching data without navigation using useFetcher.
